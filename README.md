# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis**, or EDA, is an important step in any Data Analysis or Data Science project.

It is the process of investigating the dataset to discover patterns, and anomalies (outliers), and form hypotheses based on our understanding of the dataset.

EDA involves generating summary **Statistics for numerical data** in the dataset and creating various **graphical representations** to understand the data better which invovles **Univariate Analysis , Bi-Variate Analysis and Multi-Variate Analysis**


EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules. More than anything, It's a **State of mind**.

In which you iteratively :

- Generate questions about your data. 
- Search for answers by visualising, transforming, and modelling your data. 
- Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions. 

## [AMEO 2015](https://github.com/Nitheesh1305/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/AMEO%20EDA.ipynb)
A dataset comprising AMCAT test scores,biodata details and employment outcomes of job seekers

### Objective :
- A relevant question is what determines the salary and the jobs these engineers are offered right after graduation.

- The data can be used not only to make an accurate salary predictor but also to understand what influences salary .

## [Adult Income Dataset](https://github.com/Nitheesh1305/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Adult%20EDA%20%2BData%20Cleaning.ipynb)
The Adult dataset is from the Census Bureau which contains year based attributes such as education, hours of work per week, etc..
### Objective :
- The task is to predict whether a given adult makes more than $50K a year based on given attributes 

## [Bigmart Sales](https://github.com/Nitheesh1305/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Big%20Mart%20Sales%20EDA.ipynb)
Bigmart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all around the country , it has collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities

### Objective :
- With this information the corporation hopes we can identify the products and stores which play a key role in their sales and use that information to take the correct measures to ensure success of their business.


## [PUBG](https://github.com/Nitheesh1305/Exploratory-Data-Analysis/blob/main/PUBG_EDA.ipynb)
PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a battle royale survival game with the goal of being the last player standing. Up to 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed with a variety of game modes that can allow squads of up to 4 people. In the game, a player can find and use a variety of weapons, items, and vehicles. Players must also avoid the shrinking “circle”, which pushes players closer together on the map.

### Objective :
 - With the growing prevalence of competitive eSports, there is a need for rich user data and analysis for improving skill. 
 
 - By exploring the data, we found valuable insights into the strategies and metrics that yield the best player performance
